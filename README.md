## Introduction

The nextstrain project is an attempt to make flexible informatic pipelines and visualization tools to track ongoing pathogen evolution as sequence data emerges. The nextstrain project derives from [nextflu](https://github.com/blab/nextflu), which was specific to influenza evolution.

The current repo is very much a work-in-progress. We recommend that you use [nextflu](https://github.com/blab/nextflu) instead for current applications. At some point, this repo will takeover from the nextflu repo.

## Auspice

*Auspice* is the web app that gives an interactive display of inferences produced by *augur* pipeline.
