> These docs are for a devlopment branch which is in flux. They are incomplete and will change frequently.

Auspice is an interactive visualisation platform for phylogenomic and other other datasets related to evolution.
It was originally designed for nextstrain.org, which aims to aims to provide a continually-updated view of publicly available pathogen genome data.
Auspice can be used locally to view datasets, or deployed to server- or serverless-websites.
It allows easy customisation of aesthetics and functionality, and powers the visualisations on [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org).

## Running Auspice Locally

Auspice by itself is a visualisation tool for local datasets.
It runs a local server to deliver the files the the visualisation to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
After [installing](installation.md), you can access datasets in the current directory by running
```bash

Please see `auspice view -h` for all available options.
