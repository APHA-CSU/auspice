# Auspice: an open-source interactive tool for visualising phylogenomic data

![splash](assets/splash.png)
*Auspice being used to show the spread of influenza H7N9 virus across Asia.*

**Auspice is software to display beautiful interactive visualisations of phylogenomic data.**


Communicating scientific results while also allowing interrogation of the underlying data is an integral part of the scientific process.
Current scientific publishing practices hinder both the rapid dissemination of epidemiologically relevant results and the ability to easily interact with the data which was used to draw the inferences.
These shortcomings motivated the [nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) project, for which auspice was initially devloped.

Auspice can be run on your computer or integrated into websites.
It allows easy customisation of aesthetics and functionality, and powers the visualisations on [nextstrain.org](https://nextstrain.org).
